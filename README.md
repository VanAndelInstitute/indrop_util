# Indrop Pipeline Utilities

This repository is intended to contain utilities facilitating processing and 
analysis of sequence data derived from the indrop single cell encapsulation 
platform. 

Thus far there are the following files:

* **indrops_pipeline_tutorial.rmd**: Beginners guide to running the analysis 
pipeline (in RMarkDown, even though the code is almost all bash)
* **[indrops_pipeline_tutorial.html](https://vanandelinstitute.github.io/indrop_util/indrops_pipeline_tutorial.html)**: 
Beginners guide to running the analysis pipeline (knitted HTML format)
* **util.r**: Some utilities for downstream analysis of counts produced from the 
indrops pipeline (to date, only a single function for creating diagnostic 
plot useful for picking counts cut off to define "cells")
